# fresh-meat-ftir
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra of samples of fresh chicken, turkey, and pork.
Spectrometer operated in the mid-infrared spectral region, using Attenuated Total Reflectance sampling. 
Raw data matrix size [448 x 120]. Provided as a .csv file, with sample descriptor in header row, and frequency (wavenumbers) in header column.
Comprises duplicate acquisitions ('RunA' and 'RunB') from 60 independent samples (20 cuts of meat or each type, obtained from various suppliers as indicat 'A' through 'E').
